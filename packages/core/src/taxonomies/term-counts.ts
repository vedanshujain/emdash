/**
 * Shared visible-usage counts for taxonomy terms (issue #581).
 *
 * `content_taxonomies` rows are written for every entry regardless of status
 * and are never pruned on unpublish/trash, so counting the pivot directly
 * inflates counts with drafts and soft-deleted entries. Every user-facing
 * count (public widget, single-term page, admin term list) must instead count
 * only entries that have completed publication:
 * `status = 'published'` AND `deleted_at IS NULL`.
 *
 * The public render path is latency-sensitive on D1, so per-collection counts
 * are combined with UNION ALL — one query per taxonomy, never one per
 * collection, split only where the backend caps compound-SELECT terms.

/**
 * Count publicly-visible term assignments for one taxonomy, keyed by the
 * term's translation_group (what `content_taxonomies.taxonomy_id` stores).
 * When `locale` is provided, only entries in that locale contribute. Omitting
 * it preserves the locale-agnostic API used by legacy callers.
 *
 * Counts are scoped to the taxonomy's declared collections — pass
 * `TaxonomyDef.collections` (`_emdash_taxonomy_defs.collections`). Declared
 * collections without a `_emdash_collections` row (the migration-seeded
 * defaults declare `posts` unconditionally) are filtered out before any SQL
 * is built, so no statement referencing a missing `ec_*` table is sent — a
 * failed statement is logged by the database even when the caller recovers,
 * flooding D1 observability with phantom errors. The missing-table guards in
 * `runBatch` stay as the backstop for registry/table drift (e.g. a partially
 * applied D1 create) and for a table dropped mid-flight, yielding a
 * partial-but-correct count rather than a throw.
 *
 * One database round-trip for the whole taxonomy (UNION ALL across
 * collections). On a backend that caps compound-SELECT terms — D1 allows five
 * — the branches are split into one statement per batch, since a taxonomy
 * declaring more collections than that would otherwise take down every path
 * that shows counts. Per-collection sums are commutative, so batching cannot
 * change the total.
 *
 * Callers on the public render path should go through the request-cached
 * wrapper in `taxonomies/index.ts` so a page rendering both the widget and a
 * term detail shares one computation.
