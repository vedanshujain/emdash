		 *   - A bare publisher DID (e.g. `"did:plc:abc123"`) -- every
		 *     package from that publisher is exempt.
		 *   - A `<did>/<slug>` pair (e.g.
		 *     `"did:plc:abc123/hotfix-plugin"`) -- only that specific
		 *     package is exempt.
		 *
		 * Whole-publisher exemptions are the common case: trust is

		 * compromised aggregator cannot lie about which DID published
		 * a release.
		 *
		 * Mirrors pnpm's `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`.

		 *   "did:plc:abc123/hotfix-plugin", // just this one package

	/**
	 * Decentralized plugin registry.
	 *
	 * When set, replaces the centralized `marketplace` for the admin UI's
	 * browse and install flows. The registry is an atproto-backed
	 * federation: package metadata lives in each publisher's PDS and
	 * an aggregator (the `aggregatorUrl`) indexes the firehose and
	 * exposes read-only XRPC endpoints for discovery.
	 *
	 * See [RFC 0001](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/694) for
	 * the protocol design.
	 *
	 * **Trust model (v1, experimental).** Today EmDash trusts the
	 * configured aggregator with these claims, per package and per
	 * release:
	 *
	 *   - The publisher DID associated with a `(did, slug)` pair.
	 *   - The artifact source fields, checksum, and cache services returned for
	 *     a release.
	 *   - The published handle for a DID (used for display only;
	 *     EmDash separately verifies the DID->handle round-trip in the
	 *     admin UI before treating a handle as confirmed).
	 *
	 * What EmDash verifies independently before activating an
	 * installed plugin:
	 *
	 *   - The artifact bytes hash to the checksum the aggregator
	 *     returned (so a malicious cache or in-transit tamper can't
	 *     swap the bundle).
	 *   - The bundle's `manifest.id` matches the requested slug, and
	 *     its `manifest.version` matches the release version (so an
	 *     attacker who controls the aggregator can't trick the
	 *     sandbox into addressing the wrong plugin id).
	 *   - The bundle's `manifest.capabilities` matches what the admin
	 *     acknowledged in the consent dialog (so a publisher can't
	 *     ship a bundle that requests more permissions than the
	 *     dialog displayed).
	 *
	 * What's NOT yet verified:
	 *
	 *   - Full MST proof / publisher signature on the release record.
	 *     A compromised aggregator can forge a release for any DID
	 *     and slug, and the install will succeed as long as the
	 *     bundle matches the (forged) checksum.
	 *   - Per-release replay / rollback: the aggregator chooses which
	 *     release version is "latest".
	 *
	 * **Recommendation.** Until full signature verification lands,
	 * point `aggregatorUrl` only at an aggregator you operate
	 * yourself or one you trust with the same level of authority as
	 * a centralized plugin source. `policy.minimumReleaseAge` widens
	 * the detection window for takedowns. `acceptLabelers` declares a
	 * request and cache identity; it does not change aggregator policy.
	 *
	 * Requires `sandboxRunner` to be configured -- registry plugins
	 * always run sandboxed.
	 *
	 * Accepts a bare URL string as shorthand for
	 * `{ aggregatorUrl: "..." }`. Use the full object form when you
	 * need `acceptLabelers` or `policy`.
