/**
 * Cloudflare Hyperdrive database adapter (PostgreSQL)
 *
 * For Cloudflare Workers connecting to an existing PostgreSQL or
 * PostgreSQL-compatible database (e.g. PlanetScale Postgres) through a
 * Hyperdrive binding. Hyperdrive pools and accelerates the connection;
 * EmDash's PostgreSQL dialect runs the queries.
 *
 * Each request gets its own pooled connection that is opened and closed within
 * that request — Worker connections cannot be reused across requests.
 *
 * Requires in the consuming site:
 * - `pg >= 8.16.3` installed
 * - `compatibility_flags: ["nodejs_compat"]`
 * - `compatibility_date >= "2024-09-23"`
 * - A Hyperdrive binding in wrangler config:
 *   ```jsonc
 *   { "hyperdrive": [{ "binding": "HYPERDRIVE", "id": "<id>" }] }
 *   ```
 *
 * **Disable Hyperdrive query caching for this configuration.** EmDash runs its
 * own caching layer and depends on read-after-write consistency — the admin and
 * setup wizard write a row and immediately read it back. Hyperdrive's default-on
 * query cache can serve the pre-write result within its TTL, which corrupts
 * setup (e.g. "collection already exists" / missing columns) and shows editors
 * stale content. Turn it off when creating the config:
 * ```sh
 * wrangler hyperdrive update <id> --caching-disabled
 * # or, at create time: wrangler hyperdrive create ... --caching-disabled
 * ```
 *
 * **Optional: serve anonymous reads from cache.** If a short public-read
 * staleness window is acceptable, pass a second `cachedBinding` pointing at a
 * caching-enabled Hyperdrive config over the same database. Anonymous public
 * reads then route through the cache-enabled binding while authenticated
 * requests and writes stay on the uncached `binding`. For a short window after
 * each content publish (default 60s; set `preferUncachedAfterWriteMs` to match
 * your Hyperdrive `max_age`), anonymous public reads also use the primary so a
 * rebuild cannot reseed edge caches from stale Hyperdrive results:
 * ```ts
 * database: hyperdrive({
 *   binding: "HYPERDRIVE",
 *   cachedBinding: "HYPERDRIVE_CACHED",
 *   // preferUncachedAfterWriteMs: 60_000, // default when cachedBinding is set
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * For best latency, pair this with a Smart Placement hint so the Worker runs in
 * the Cloudflare data center closest to your database's region — the request
 * path makes multiple round trips, so co-locating the Worker with the origin
 * matters:
 * ```jsonc
 * { "placement": { "region": "aws:us-east-1" } }
 * ```
 *
 * Each request gets its own pg connection, and the Cron Trigger sweep, plugin
 * hook contexts, and media providers resolve an event-scoped connection too, so
 * the content read/write path, scheduled publishing, plugin cron, and
 * DB-querying plugin hooks are all supported.
 *
 * **Known limitation — sandboxed plugins are D1-only.** The sandbox plugin
 * bridge talks to a D1 binding directly (independent of the configured
 * adapter), so sandboxed plugins aren't available on a Hyperdrive deployment.
 * This is a pre-existing bridge constraint, unrelated to connection scoping;
 * tracked in https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/issues/1623.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * database: hyperdrive({ binding: "HYPERDRIVE" })
