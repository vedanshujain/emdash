/**
 * Jetstream ingestor. Subscribes to a Jetstream client, converts commit
 * events into `RecordsJob` messages, enqueues them, and persists the
 * cursor so reconnects resume cleanly.
 *
 * Owns:
 *   - Connection lifecycle (connect → consume → disconnect → backoff →
 *     reconnect, indefinitely until `stop()` is called).
 *   - Cursor persistence after each successful enqueue. Persisting AFTER
 *     enqueue means a crash can replay the most recent event; downstream
 *     ingest is idempotent (DO NOTHING on duplicate releases) so this is
 *     safe and strictly better than the alternative of skipping events.
 *   - Exponential backoff with jitter, capped, reset on each successful
 *     event.
 *
 * Pure constructor injection — no DO/D1/Queue infrastructure imports — so
 * unit tests instantiate it directly with `MockJetstream` + an in-memory
 * queue + a `Map`-backed storage.
